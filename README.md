# 🚀 Laravel Advanced File Manager

A powerful, production-ready **Laravel file manager package** with OS-like UI, media library, and file picker mode. Designed to be a drop-in solution for handling media, documents, and folders with a modern, responsive interface.

## 🚀 Usage

### 1. Standalone Dashboard
Access the full file manager dashboard at:
```
/file-manager
```
(You can change this route in `config/file-manager.php`)

### 2. File Picker Mode (Integration)
Want to use this file manager to select files for a form in your own application? Use the **Picker Mode**.

**How it works:**
1. Open the file manager in a popup window with specific query parameters.
2. The user selects file(s) and clicks "Confirm Selection".
3. The window closes and sends the selected file data back to your main window via `postMessage`.

**Example Implementation:**

```javascript
// Function to open the File Manager
function openFileManager() {
    // Params:
    // pickerMode=true  -> Enables selection mode
    // multiple=false   -> Set to true for multi-select
    const width = 1000;
    const height = 700;
    const left = (screen.width - width) / 2;
    const top = (screen.height - height) / 2;

    window.open(
        '/file-manager?pickerMode=true&multiple=false', 
        'FileManager', 
        `width=${width},height=${height},top=${top},left=${left},resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes`
    );
}

// Listen for the selection event
window.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
    // Verify usage if running on different domains, generally optional for same-origin
    if (event.data.type === 'fm_selection') {
        const file = event.data.file; // OR event.data.files if multiple=true
        
        console.log('User selected:', file);
        
        // Example: Update your form inputs
        // document.getElementById('featured_image_input').value = file.url;
        // document.getElementById('preview_img').src = file.url;
    }
});
```

### 3. API Usage
You can also use the backend service programmatically.

```php
use Iqonic\FileManager\Facades\FileManager;

// Upload a file
$file = FileManager::upload($request->file('avatar'));

// Create a folder
$folder = FileManager::createFolder('New Gallery');

// Get Files in a Folder
$files = FileManager::listFiles(['folder_id' => $folder->id]);
```

---

### 4. Image Variants & Responsive Images
Every image upload automatically generates optimized variants based on your config.

```php
// Get URL for specific size (thumbnail, small, medium, large)
$url = $file->getVariantUrl('medium');

// Get responsive srcset for <img> tags
// Returns: "url_small.jpg 400w, url_medium.jpg 800w..."
$srcset = $file->srcset; 
```

### 5. User Preferences & Favorites
Store user-specific settings and mark files as favorites.

```php
use Iqonic\FileManager\Models\UserPreference;

// Save a preference
UserPreference::set($user->id, 'theme', 'dark');

// Retrieve a preference
$theme = UserPreference::get($user->id, 'theme', 'light');
```

### 6. Headless API
This package provides a full JSON API secured by Laravel Sanctum for headless implementations.

**Authentication:**
- Supports standard Web Session (for dashboard) OR Sanctum Tokens (for external apps).
- Issue Token: `POST /api/auth/token`
- Get User: `GET /api/user`

**Endpoints:**
All dashboard routes are available via API (e.g., `GET /api/files`, `POST /api/files/upload`), returning JSON responses.

### 7. Keyboard Shortcuts
Navigate faster with built-in hotkeys:
- **`?`**: Show Help Modal
- **`Ctrl/Cmd + A`**: Select All Files
- **`Delete` / `Backspace`**: Delete Selected Files
- **`Esc`**: Clear Selection / Close Modals

## ⚙️### Secure File Sharing
Share files with external users securely:
- **Public Links**: Generate unique, shareable URLs.
- **Password Protection**: Optional password requirement.
- **Expiration**: Set expiry dates for links.
- **Download Limits**: Restrict max number of downloads.

```php
// Generate programmatically
$share = $fileManager->createShareLink($file, [
    'password' => 'secret123',
    'expires_at' => now()->addDays(7),
    'max_downloads' => 5
]);

echo route('share.show', $share->token);
```
