# 🚀 Laravel Advanced File Manager

A powerful, production-ready **Laravel file manager package** with OS-like UI, media library, and file picker mode. Designed to be a drop-in solution for handling media, documents, and folders with a modern, responsive interface.

## 🚀 Usage

### 1. Standalone Dashboard
Access the full file manager dashboard at:
```
/file-manager
```
(You can change this route in `config/file-manager.php`)

### 2. File Picker Mode (Integration)
Want to use this file manager to select files for a form in your own application? Use the **Picker Mode**.

**How it works:**
1. Open the file manager in a popup window with specific query parameters.
2. The user selects file(s) and clicks "Confirm Selection".
3. The window closes and sends the selected file data back to your main window via `postMessage`.

**Example Implementation:**

```javascript
// Function to open the File Manager
function openFileManager() {
    // Params:
    // pickerMode=true  -> Enables selection mode
    // multiple=false   -> Set to true for multi-select
    const width = 1000;
    const height = 700;
    const left = (screen.width - width) / 2;
    const top = (screen.height - height) / 2;

    window.open(
        '/file-manager?pickerMode=true&multiple=false', 
        'FileManager', 
        `width=${width},height=${height},top=${top},left=${left},resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes`
    );
}

// Listen for the selection event
window.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
    // Verify usage if running on different domains, generally optional for same-origin
    if (event.data.type === 'fm_selection') {
        const file = event.data.file; // OR event.data.files if multiple=true
        
        console.log('User selected:', file);
        
        // Example: Update your form inputs
        // document.getElementById('featured_image_input').value = file.url;
        // document.getElementById('preview_img').src = file.url;
    }
});
```

### 3. API Usage
You can also use the backend service programmatically.

```php
use Iqonic\FileManager\Facades\FileManager;

// Upload a file
$file = FileManager::upload($request->file('avatar'));

// Create a folder
$folder = FileManager::createFolder('New Gallery');

// Get Files in a Folder
$files = FileManager::listFiles(['folder_id' => $folder->id]);
```
